# Week 2

Time spent: 6h

## What I did

- Decided to use Moving AI grid maps for path finding
- Added ability to parse .map files (all symbols not yet supported)
- Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm

## What am I going to do next

- Implement diagonal movement in maps
- Parse .map.scen files for benchmark info
- Ability to run benchmarks based on said info
- Improve Dijkstra's algorithm (early exit, use arrays instead of HashMaps?)
- Start work on A*

## Thoughts and questions
