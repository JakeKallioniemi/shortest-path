# Week 1

Time spent: 2h

## What I did

Decided what to do and set up the project.

## What am I going to do next

- Decide on what material to use for pathfinding
- Parsing said material
- Implement Dijkstra

## Thoughts and questions

Last time I had to drop out because of some external factors. This time there shouldn't be any problems but I picked a safe topic for the project just in case.
