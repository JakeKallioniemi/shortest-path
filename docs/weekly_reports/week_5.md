# Week 5

Time spent: 6h

## What I did

- Made some small improvements based on peer review 
- Implemented my own version of binary heap
- Expanded UI
- Added benchmarks comparing my own data structures to Java standard library

## What am I going to do next

- Implement hash table or modify algorithms so that hash table isn't needed
- Add JPS
- Continue writing documentation
- Add some more info to map benchmarks

## Thoughts and questions

Didn't get much done this week. Notably JPS is still missing. I'll try to get it done as soon as possible, maybe tomorrow.
